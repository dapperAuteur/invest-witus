"""Fixtures every test file shares. pytest loads this file on its own; nothing imports it.

Added in chapter 05, when tests started creating users: Django's default password hasher is slow
on purpose (it is meant to make guessing expensive), which turns every `admin_client` into half a
second of setup. Tests use the fast hasher instead; the real one still guards real logins.
