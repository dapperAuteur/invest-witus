"""Two POST views on the signed-in owner's account page: add one or many symbols, remove one.

Both check ownership the way chapter 08's pages do: the account comes from
`get_object_or_404(Account, pk=pk, owner=request.user)`, so another owner's account is a 404.
Both finish with a redirect to the account page (Post/Redirect/Get, as chapter 04's waitlist),
carrying their report in Django's messages, which the base template prints once.
